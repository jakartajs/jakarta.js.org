This project is based on the default Gatsby starter

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

## Develop

A nodejs >= 6.0.0 setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# ...or if you'd like to use npm instead
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
npm run develop

# build for production
npm run build
```
